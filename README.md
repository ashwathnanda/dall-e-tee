# DALL-E-TEE

This project is a demonstration of using DALL-E and ThreeJS to generate an image of a custom-designed t-shirt. DALL-E is a transformer-based neural network model that generates images from textual descriptions. ThreeJS is a JavaScript library that is used to render 3D graphics in a browser. In this project, we use DALL-E to generate a textual description of a t-shirt and use ThreeJS to model the t-shirt in 3D.
